About This Project
Project Name: PDF Text Extraction and Labeling
Description:
This project extracts text data from PDF documents and labels each document according to its category (e.g., "chase" or "non-chase"). The extracted text is organized by page and saved into a CSV file, which can be used for further data processing, such as training machine learning models.

How It Works:
The code utilizes the PyMuPDF (fitz) library to extract text from each page of the PDF files.
The extracted text is associated with a label that corresponds to the category of the document.
The text and labels are then combined into a Pandas DataFrame and saved as a CSV file, with a download link provided for easy access.
Input:
A list of PDF files with their respective labels is provided in the code. The user can modify this list to include their own PDF files.
Output:
The code outputs a CSV file named dataset.csv, containing the extracted text from the PDFs and their associated labels.
Each row of the CSV file contains the page number, extracted text, and the label of the document it came from.
Use Case:
This tool is useful for classifying documents, building datasets for training machine learning models (e.g., text classification using BERT), or simply organizing and analyzing large sets of PDFs.

Instructions:
Install dependencies: Ensure that PyMuPDF and Pandas are installed in your environment.
Add PDFs: Update the pdfs_with_labels list in the code with the paths to your PDFs and their corresponding labels.
Run the script: Execute the script to generate the CSV file.
Download the CSV: The script will generate and provide a download link for the CSV file containing the extracted text and labels.
